# Git Workflow for ft_transcendence Project

This document describes the Git branching strategy and workflow that developers should follow when working on this project.

## Branching Strategy

We follow a **Git Flow**-inspired workflow with the following branches:

- **`main`** (Green): The main production-ready branch. Only release versions are merged here.
- **`dev`** (Yellow): The main development branch where all features and bug fixes are merged.
- **`feature/*`** (Gray): Temporary branches for developing new functionality.
- **`bugfix/*`** (Purple): Temporary branches used to address non-critical bugs or issues.
